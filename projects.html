            <p>
                Managing studies efficiently is crucial for students. Our **Study Buddy App** will provide a **smart AI assistant** 
                that helps students organize their tasks, create schedules, and answer study-related questions. It will allow users 
                to **upload notes, collaborate in study groups**, and get instant responses to academic queries. The app will make 
                studying more interactive and efficient.

            <p>
                Art should be accessible to everyone. Our **Virtual Art Gallery** will allow artists to **showcase their work online** 
                in a fully interactive **3D web environment**. Viewers can explore different rooms, zoom in on paintings, and learn 
                about artists. The gallery will also have a **buy/sell** feature, enabling artists to monetize their work. This project 
                blends **technology, creativity, and accessibility** in a unique way.

            <p>
                Building good habits is difficult, but **gamification** can make it fun! Our **Gamified Habit Tracker** will turn 
                daily habits into an interactive game. Users can **set goals, complete challenges, and earn XP points** as they 
                progress. A **leaderboard** will add friendly competition, and rewards will motivate users to stay consistent. 
                This project promotes **self-improvement and engagement** in an exciting way!
